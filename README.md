# 42-Fractol

My second graphic project. A project designed to draw and manipulate fractol for 42. Contains eight fractal, six which are custom made fractals with Julia base. There is a big improvement in terms of coding and understanding from FDF to Fractol, cleaner code and better use of structs can be seen as well as a better and more thorough understanding of the MLX library, within the time frame of this project getting done after FDF (which is less than a week) alot of new knowledge was learned and gained. This can be seen clearly between the differences of FDF to Fractol.
